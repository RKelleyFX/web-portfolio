This application is set up as a personal web portfolio that has blog type functionality. 

I've created a login function that allows me to access the post management components. These components will allow me to select the route that I want the post to render in as well as attach any relevant data. I will also be able to delete and modify any posts as desired. 

I will be configuring the posts in a NoSQL structure which will be hosted on AWS DynamoDB.
